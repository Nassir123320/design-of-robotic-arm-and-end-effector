# design-of-hydraulic robotic-arm-and-end-effector
in this task I made a design of mechanical robotic arm and end effector by using CINIMA 4D program .
this mechanical robotic arm made of 2 links  and end effector
and there is hydraulic system between the first link and the effector to make smooth motion and to support the effector .
there is two types of joints in this arm :
1- Cylindrical : which joint the first link to the base and another one to joint the first link with the second , the purpose of this type of joints is to allow 180 degree of freedom around z axis .
2- spherical : which joint the effector eith the second link , the purpose of this type of joints is to allow 360 degree around all axis .
